# spam-detection


Data collection involves compiling an email dataset that has been classified as spam or not (ham).
Preprocessing: converting text data into numerical features, like TF-IDF vectors, and cleaning it up.
Model selection is selecting an appropriate classification algorithm, such as neural networks, SVM, or Naive Bayes.
Training: The selected model is trained to differentiate between spam and ham emails using the labeled data.
Evaluation: Measuring the model's effectiveness with F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall.
Deployment: Integrating the learned model with an email system to categorize incoming emails automatically.
Iterative Improvement: Increasing detection accuracy by iteratively updating and improving the model in light of fresh data.
